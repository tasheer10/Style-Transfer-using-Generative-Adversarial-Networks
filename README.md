# Style-Transfer-using-Generative-Adversarial-Networks

###  Problem statement:

To build a Generative adversarial model(modified U-Net) which can generate artificial MRI images of different contrast levels from existing MRI scans.

### Approch

We will use CycleGAN to translate the style of one MRI image to another, which will help in a better understanding of the scanned image. Using GANs we will create T2 weighted images from T1 weighted MRI image and vice-versa.
